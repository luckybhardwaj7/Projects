# Sentiment Analysis of Tweets

## Overview

This project involves performing sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets to gain insights into the emotional tones and opinions expressed by users. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that classifies text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

## Project Goals

- Analyze a dataset of tweets to understand the distribution of sentiments.
- Determine the percentage of positive, negative, and neutral tweets.
- Visualize the sentiment distribution using graphs and word clouds.
- Provide meaningful insights into the sentiments conveyed in the tweets.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains a collection of tweets. Each tweet is analyzed to classify its sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Analysis Steps

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the text data for analysis.
2. Sentiment Classification: Using machine learning or rule-based methods to classify tweets into sentiments.
3. Sentiment Distribution: Calculating the percentage of positive, negative, and neutral tweets.
4. Visualization: Creating graphs and word clouds to visualize sentiment distribution and key words.
5. Conclusion: Summarizing the findings and insights derived from the sentiment analysis.

## Results

The sentiment analysis of the tweets data yielded the following outcomes:

- **Neutral Tweets:** The majority of tweets (47.8%) were classified as neutral, indicating a balanced expression of opinions or information.
- **Positive Tweets:** Approximately 44.7% of the tweets exhibited positive sentiments, reflecting an optimistic or favorable tone.
- **Negative Tweets:** A smaller percentage (7.5%) of tweets conveyed negative sentiments, suggesting that negative tones were less dominant in the dataset.
